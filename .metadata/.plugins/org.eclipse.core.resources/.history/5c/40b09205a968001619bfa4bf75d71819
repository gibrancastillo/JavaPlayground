/**
 * Resource based (not action based) URI class API.  In this case the resource is 'messages'.  The HTTP Methods tell you the operation to be made on the resource.
 * 
 * HTTP Request       SQL          Operation   
 *   Method        Statement
 * <> POST   --->   INSERT     --> 'C'reate              (Non-Idempotence)
 * <> GET    --->   SELECT     --> 'R'ead (Retrieve)
 * <> PUT    --->   UPDATE     --> 'U'pdate (Modify)     (Idempotence)
 * <> DELETE --->   DELETE     --> 'D'elete (Destroy)
 * 
 * You can use the HTTP Method POST to perform an update operation; however, the standard practice is to use the HTTP Method PUT.  HTTP Method POST is use for creating a new resource.
 * The HTTP Method GET is read-only; while POST, PUT and DELETE are write HTTP Methods.
 * The following are repeatable (Idempotence) HTTP Methods:  GET, PUT and DELETE.  Meaning that can be applied safely multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application.
 * The HTTP Method POST cannot be repeated safely (Non-Idempotence).
 * 
 * 
 * A bit uncommon:  HEAD, OPTIONS, etc.
