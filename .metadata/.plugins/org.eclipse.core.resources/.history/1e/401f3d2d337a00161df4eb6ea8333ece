/**
 * Creating Invocations - you can prepare an HTTP Request and put in all the things you need that HTTP Request to do.
 * For instance, you need to know where the target is, what is the HTTP Request format, what is the body of the HTTP Request, the HTTP Method.
 * The idea is to create an HTTP Request object which contains all the information about the request, except you have not made the HTTP Request.
 * Therefore, you can pass around this HTTP Request object and have some other code issued a request without knowing what the request is, without
 * knowing the details of that request because is already ready to be issued or executed.
 * 
 * API to get all messages by year:  /webapi/messages?year={year}
