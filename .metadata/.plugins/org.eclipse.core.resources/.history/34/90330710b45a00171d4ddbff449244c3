/**
 * A Hash Table data structure with a hashing function that handles collisions with Open Addressing using <<< Double Hashing >>>.
 * 
 * Hashing - The process of accessing a record by mapping a key value to a position in the table
 * Hash Function - The function that maps key values to positions in the table.  A good hash function will have the following properties:
 * 1. Efficiently computable
 * 2. Should uniformly distribute the keys (Each table position equally likely for each key)
 * Hash Table - The array that holds the records
 * Slots - A position (index) in the hash table.
 * Open Addressing - Also called Closed Hashing, all elements are stored in the hash table (array) itself.
 *                 <> Linear Probing, Quadratic Probing, Double Hashing, etc.
 * 
 * If we think of a Hash Table as an array then a hash function is used to generate a unique key for every item in the array.
 * The position the item goes in is known as the slot. Hashing doesn't work very well in situations in which duplicate data is stored.
 * Also it isn't good for searching for anything except a specific key. However, a Hash Table is a data structure that offers fast
 * insertion, deletion and searching capabilities.
 * 
 * From the String key you get the hash code (a.k.a hash value), from the hash code you get the index in the array.
 * 
 * ====================================================================================================================================
 * Clustering - once a collision occurs, you significally increase chances that another collision will occurs in the same slot or area
 *              This tendency of linear probing to cluster items together is known as Primary Clustering.
 *              Another technique that eliminates primary clustering is called Quadratic Probing
 *              
 * Quadratic Probing - the ith value in the probe sequence is (h(K) + i^2) mod M.  Thus, the probe function is p(K, i) = i^2 
 *                     Once again, two keys with different home positions will have diverge probe sequences.
 *                     
 * Example:  For a hash table of size M = 101, assume for keys k1 and k2 that h(k1) = 30 and h(k2) = 29.  The probe sequence for k1 is 30,
 * then 31, then 34, then 39.  The probe sequence for k2 is 29, then 30, then 33, then 38.  Thus, while k2 will probe to k1's home position
 * as its second choice, the two keys' probe sequence diverge immediately thereafter.
 * 
 * Pseudo-random probing p(K, i) = Perm[i - 1] and quadratic probing p(K, i) = i^2 eliminate primary clustering; however, if the hash
 * function causes a cluster to a particular home position, then the cluster remains under pseudo-random and quadratic probing.  This
 * problem is called secondary clustering.
 * 
 * 
 * <<< Double Hashing >>> - to avoid secondary clustering, we need to have the probe sequence be a function of the original key value, not the
 *                  home position.  A simple technique for doing this is to return to linear probing for the probe function, but to have
 *                  the constant be based on a second hash function.  Thus, the probe sequence would be of the form:  p(K, i) = i * h2(K)
 * 
 * Example:  Again, assume a hash table has size M = 101, and that there are three keys k1, k2 and k3 with h(k1) = 30, h(k2) = 29, h(k3) = 30,
 * h2(k1) = 2, h2(k2) = 5, and h2(k3) = 5.  Then, the probe sequence for k1 will be 30, 32, 34, 36, and so on.  The probe sequence for k2 will
 * be 28, 33, 38, 43, and so on.  The probe sequence for k3 will be 30, 35, 40, 45, and so on.  Thus, none of the keys share substantial
 * portions of the same probe sequence.  Of course, if a fourth key k4 has h(k4) = 28 and h2(k4) = 2, then it will follow the same probe
 * sequence as k1.  Pseudo-random or quadractic probing can be combined with double hashing to solve this problem.
 * 
 * A good implementation of double hashing should ensure that all of the probe sequence constants are relatively prime (prime numbers)
 * to the table size M.  One way is to select M to be a prime number, and have h2 return a value in the range 1 =< h2(K) =< M - 1.
 * Another way is to set M = 2^m for some value m and let h2 return an odd value between 1 and 2^m.
 * Using a prime number for the hash table (array) size helps minimize collisions.
 * ====================================================================================================================================
 * 
 * Time Complexity
 * A good hash table and a good hash function gives you a constant time O(1) but
 * linear time O(n) in the worst case scenario (lost of collisions, etc)
