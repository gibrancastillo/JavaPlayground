/**
 * There are two types of filters in JAX-RS:
 * <> ContainerRequestFilter - a filter that executes before the HTTP Request is served.  Here you are intercepting the HTTP Request.
 * 
 * <> ContainerResponseFilter - a filter that executes after the HTTP Response is prepared and it's about to be sent to the client.
 *                              Here you are intercepting the HTTP Response.
 * 
 * This custom HTTP Response Filter class uses the @Provider annotation to register itself with JAX-RS, so that JAX-RS knows that
 * this custom HTTP Response Filter is available, so when this messenger RESTful API is about to sent the HTTP Response to the client
 * JAX-RS is able to find this custom response filter and utilize it.
 * 
 * In order to register this class as a custom PoweredByResponseFilter for JAX-RS we annotate the class with @Provider to this class.
