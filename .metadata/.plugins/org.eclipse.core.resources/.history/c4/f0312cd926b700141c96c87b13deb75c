/**
 * A Hash Table is just an array couple with a function, which is called the hash function.
 * The Hash Function takes a piece of data as input [a key] and outputs an integer commonly refer to as a hash value.
 * The Hash Value maps the input [a key] to a particular index in the hash table [an array].
 * Initially the hash function is used to determine where in the hash table [an array] to store a given key.  Later you use
 * the same hash function to determine where in the hash table to search for a given key.
 * 
 * When two different inputs or keys hash to the same index in the hash function we have a collision.  Therefore, hashing functions
 * must include some form of collision resolution policy.  Collision resolution techniques can be broken into two classes: 
 * 1.  Closed Hashing or Open Addressing:
 *     There are three common closed hashing or open addressing collision resolution strategies:
 *     - Linear Probing:  All data go inside the hash table [array], thus a bigger hash table is needed.  Generally the load factor should be below 0.5.
 *                        If a key hashes to the same index as the previously stored key, it is assigned to the next available slot or index in the hash table.
 *                        Primary Clustering:  As you can see once a collision occurs, you significantly increase chances that another collision will occur in the same slot.
 *                        Primary Clustering is a serious drawback to linear probing.  Moreover, worst-case insertion, deletion, and lookup times have devolved to O(n), as
 *                        the next available slot could have potentially been the last slot in the hash table.
 *     - Quadratic Probing:  Eliminates primary clustering problem of linear probing.  
 *     - Double hashing:  A second hash function is used to drive the collision resolution.  We apply a second hash function to x [input key] and probe
 *                        at a distance.
 *     
 *     
 * 2.  Open Hashing or Separate Chaining: 
 *     An array of pointers to singly linked list(s). 
 *     The idea is to keep a singly linked list in each index for all keys that hash to the same hash value [to a particular index].
 *     The hash table [array] indexes are pointers to the first nodes of the singly linked list. 
 *     A new node is inserted to the front or head of the singly linked list, which is O(1).
 *     The worst case lookup time is O(n/k), where k is the size of the hash table.  k is a constant.
 *     In the real world O(n/k) can be a huge improvement; for example, assume that k is 10.  Would you rather wait 100 seconds or 100/k = 10 seconds.
 *     
 *     Advantages:
 *     - Better space utilization for large items
 *     - Simple collision handling:  searching a singly linked list.
 *     - Overflow:  we can store more items than the hash table [array] size.
 *     - Deletion is quick and easy:  deletion from the singly linked list.
 *  
 *  
 *  Resolving collisions entails one sort of linear search or another, which slows things down considerably.
 *  Therefore, you'll want to choose a hash function that minimizes the chance of collisions occurring in the first place.
 *  The following are some properties of good hash functions:
 *  <> Makes use of all info provided by key, in order to maximize the number of possible hash values.
 *     For example, if we had two strings, "cat" and "caterpillar", we'd want them to hash to different places on the hash table
 *     If a hash function only took into account the first one, two, or even three letters of the strings, a collision would occur,
 *     since both words start wit the same three letters.
 *  <> Uniformly distributes output across hash table.  In other words, hash values should be spread evenly across the hash table.
 *     This will reduce the length of a singly linked list should collisions occur in the case of Open Hashing or Separate Chaining.
 *  <> Maps similar keys to very different hash values.  In other words, your hash function should be capable of generating very
 *     different hash values for similar keys, making collisions much less likely.
 *  <> Uses only very fast operations.  Speedy insertion, deletion and lookup; therefore, make sure your hash function uses simple,
 *     quick operations to minimize run time.
 *  
 *  
 *  Hash Tables are NOT efficient in operations that require any ordering information among elements [slots or indexes], such
 *  as findMin, findMax and printing the entire hash table in sorted order.
 *  
 *  
 *  This class implements a Hash Table [array] that uses a Open Hashing or Separate Chaining collision resolution policy.
