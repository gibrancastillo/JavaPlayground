/**
 * This is a RESTful Web Service
 * 
 * Web Services
 * ============
 * The exchange of data happens over the Web via the HTTP protocol.  The HTTP exchanges is as follows:  The Client sends an HTTP Request to the Server and when the Server is done
 * processing the HTTP Request, it sends an HTTP Response back to the Client.  This flow is similar to the websites; however, for Web Services the HTTP Response instead of containing
 * HTML, CSS and JavaScript formatting/styling for a website, it only return the data (XML or JSON) for the Client (a program, not a human).
 * 
 * The HTTP Protocol is the Message Format that the Client and the Server can understand.
 * 
 * Service Definition:  need to know the name of the class, the methods available, the methods arguments, the return type; in other words, you need to know about the API.  This concept
 * applies for Web Services, you need to know what the Web Service you are calling does, the operations, method argument, return type.  In other words, is a definition about the web service.
 * 
 * 
 * Web Services Types:
 * <> REST Web Service, modern and lightweight and uses a lot of concepts behind HTTP which is the protocol use by the web.  REST Web Services has no protocol or no rules, it can send/receive
 * messages in XML, JSON or text format, as long as the Client and Server understand each other.  Messages can be exchange in any or all HTTP Methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).  There
 * are some guidelines on which HTTP method to use depending on the operation you are trying to execute, but there are no rules.  There is little to no Service Definition in REST Web Services.
 * WADL is not a very popular service definition for REST Web Services.  Nowadays, those who want others to use their REST Web Services they create an API website with instructions on how
 * to call their REST Web Services (APIs).  RESTful Web Services do NOT have Specifications, it is a concept, is an idea.  Roy Fielding introduce the term REST, back in 2000.  Furthermore, 
 * Roy Fielding is one of the authors of the HTTP specification.
 * 
 * - REpresentational State Transfer, it is not about Web Services at all; instead, it is an architecture style about the decisions and choices you have to make and the criteria and constraints
 *                                    you have to take into account.  It is a set of guidelines that work together.  When you apply the REST architecture guidelines for implementing/creating
 *                                    web services, then the Web Services become RESTful Web Services.
 * 
 * Therefore, depending how closely you follow the REST architecture style and guidelines to implement/create web services will determine how RESTful are you Web Services:
 * + Not RESTful Web Services
 * + Not fully RESTful Web Services
 * + Completely RESTful Web Services
 * 
 * The main factor to think about when designing a RESTful Web Service API is to make it easy for the consumer, clients and developer to maintain. 
 * 
 * <> SOAP Web Service, Simple Object Access Protocol (name is discontinue but we are stuck with the acronym) that uses the SOAP protocol in the XML format with rules that detail
 * the structure and contents of the XML.  Messages are only exchange in HTTP Method POST.  The Service Definition use in SOAP Web Services is WSDL, is a document that defines what the
 * 	SOAP Web Service does.  It has all the details, the methods, return type, arguments, etc.  SOAP Web Services follow the SOAP Web Service Specification, basically a set of rules that 
 * dictate what every SOAP Web Service should be.  If a SOAP Web Service does not follow one of the SOAP Web Service Specification rules, is by definition not a SOAP Web Service.
