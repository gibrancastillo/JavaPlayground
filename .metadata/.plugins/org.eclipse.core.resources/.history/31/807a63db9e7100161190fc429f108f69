/**
 * This is not a REST Web Application, we are not using a web.xml nor a (Jersey) Servlet.  This is just a RESTful Application.
 * The way we configure and bootstrap the JAX-RS Application (RESTful Application) is by writing a Jersey Servlet in web.xml and this is how
 * 
 * 1. Defined an application (not web application) which extends javax.ws.rs.core.Application which tells Jersey that this is a JAX-RS Application
 * 2. Annotated the application with @ApplicationPath("webapi") which says that any HTTP Request that comes to this RESTful Application that has /webapi/ 
 *    in the front of the URI is handle by MyApp.class so by default an as specify in javax.ws.rs.core.Application this application looks at every resource
 *    in with @Path.
