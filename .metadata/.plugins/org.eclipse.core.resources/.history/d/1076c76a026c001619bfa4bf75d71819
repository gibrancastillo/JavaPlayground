 * This is a sub-resource based class use by root resource(s).
 * The value in the @Path annotation at the class level is only going to have "/", no real value denoting that the path value to be use is the remainder
 * of the path coming from the root resource; in other words, if the user executed http://localhost:8080/messenger/webapi/messages/12/comments/1, then the
 * root resource method call was map with '/12/comments' and the remainder '1' would be pass to this sub resource to be use by the correct method in this
 * sub resource class based on the HTTP Request method and the method's @Path('{commentId}) map to the remainder of the path pass to this sub-resource class.
 * NOTE that the class level @Path annotation is optional for sub resources.
