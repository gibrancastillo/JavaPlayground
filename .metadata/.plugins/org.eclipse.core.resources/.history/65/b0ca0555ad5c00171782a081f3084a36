/**
 * The Linked Stack implementation is a simplified version of the Linked List implementation.
 * Elements or nodes are inserted (push) and removed (pop) only from the head of the list (first link or node).
 * The header node is not used because no special case code is required for lists of zero or one elements.
 * 
 * A Singly Linked Stack List that will be reference in the indices in the hash table [array].
 * 
 * The freelist is an example of a linked stack.  A freelist holds those list nodes that are not currently used.
 * When a node (link or element) is deleted from a linked list, it is placed at the head of the freelist.
 * When a new element is to be added to a linked list, the freelist is checked to see if a list node is available.
 * If so, the node is take from the freelist.  If the freelist is empty, or does not have the node you are looking
 * for the standard new operator can still be called.

	 * Clustering - once a collision occurs, you significally increase chances that another collision will occurs in the same slot or area
	 *              This tendency of linear probing to cluster items together is known as Primary Clustering.
	 *              Another technique that eliminates primary clustering is called Quadratic Probing
	 *              
	 * Ordering the Linked List by key value provides an advantage in the case of an unsuccessful search, since we know to stop searching
	 * the list once we encounter a key that is greater than the one being searched for.  If records on the list are unordered or ordered
	 * by frequency, then an unsuccessful search will need to visit every record on the list.
	 * 
     * Open Hashing (separate chaining) is most appropriate when the hash table is kept in main memory, implemented with a standard in-memory
	 * linked list.  Storing an open hash table on disk in an efficient way is difficult, since members of a given linked list may be stored
	 * on different disk blocks.  This would result in multiple disk accesses when searching for a particular key value, which defeats
	 * the purpose of using hashing.
