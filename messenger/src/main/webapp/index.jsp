	<!-- The reason you get the superclass "javax.servlet.HttpServlet" was not found on the Java Build Path of this app
	     is because Maven (a project management utility) arch type needs to have a list of all the jars the project would need
	     and the "javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet" is missing but HttpServlet is provided by Tomcat (web container)
	     You can also fix this by adding the Tomcat (web container) runtime to the Project Facet Axis2 Web Services in the messenger project -->
